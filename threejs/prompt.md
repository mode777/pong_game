# Three.js Showcase

Write a small threejs website that loads a skinned 3d character from a glb file and cycles through the animations

- Main html file in /threejs/index.html
- JS code as a module in /threejs/main.js
- Load threejs from cdn
- App loads character from /threejs/sk_adventure_warrior_01.glb
- Display character and play all the animations contained in the glb files one after another
- Make sure canvas is full-screen but limit rendering resolution to 1024x786
- Optimize for speed make sure threejs is operating as efficient as possible, do not add shadow mapping, use simple lighting model (may drop down to vertex lighting if it makes sense performance wise) 
- use a single directional light.
